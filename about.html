      <h1>About</h1>
      Hello! I'm Sabrina Ko (she/they), a frontend engineer with full-stack experience.
      <br><br>I'm passionate about learning continously, creating products that add meaningful value to the users' lives, and uniting my arts background and critical problem solving skills to develop enjoyable code. My hope is my work as a software engineer brings about positive change, and is accessible to all who need it.
      <br><br>Outside of tech, I enjoy gardening, crafting, and exploring the city for the best chai lattes.
      <br>I live in Philadelphia with my 2 cats, Milo and Sophie.
