                    As a kid, I became interested in game design. This lead me to learn how to use a simple game development software and some basics on hosting servers, and from then on I was intrigued by computers and all we can do with them.

                        But, I put down my interest in programming, until college. In that time, I focused on my creative writing, another passion of mine. My sophomore year at Smith College, I went out on a limb to reconnect with that same interest I had years ago and took a Women in Game Programming course at the neighboring college. I was surprised how quickly I picked up concepts, and continued studying Computer Science. This lead me to where I currently am, working as a software engineer with experience in different health-tech startups in the Philadelphia area.

                        I'm interested in using my experience and talent to help others, be it to create meaningful connections, facilitate processes, or make art.
